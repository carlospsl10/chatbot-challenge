#goal
design an architecture to create a AI-powered chatbot for an Order Status Service (suppose it gets information from an ecommerce platform) and it needsto be able to interact with clients. The chatbot must be polite, mantain focus on delivering an excellent customer experience, and provide accurate, specific information about the chosen product.

which strategies, programing languages, advices, do you recommend to create this software product.

Do not provide any code, concentrate into the design, components and interactions

Provide some diagram to see the flows if possible.

############################################################################################################################

let's minimize the approach, the idea is to have a small MVP where anybody can see the interaction between a client and a chatbot. Follow these instructions:
- just consider a web application and a back end application.
- authentication and session management is required
- do not consider an apigateway
- only consider clients, orders, customers working with the chatbot
- do not consider working with kubernetes (docker is ok) 
- orders must already exist, the idea is to get information from them.
- consider spring boot project with its dependencies. (do not generate any code so far)

#role you are an expert business analyst

#objective
write clear, actionable user stories and map them to REST endpoints you just described above.

create a md file named user-stories.md with 4-5 stories. Each story must include:
- persona
- story statement
- benefit 
- acceptance criteria
- mapped endpoint (e.g, 'GET /orders/{id}')

#objective
Prepare the scaffolding for front end app (FE) and backend app (BE) projects taking into account the recommendations you gave me above (reactjs for FE, spring boot for BE). Consider the following recomentations: 

- One folder for FE app and other folder for BE app
- Generate directory layout, sample routes, and a basic README.md file

Make a git commit with a short explanation specifying the initial scaffold

##############
change the following things from the backend application:
- remove the AuthController class.
- from OrderController class, remove the OrderService component and add a dummy data for each endpoint without using any external service.
- do not forget to remove unnecesary imports
- remove the LoginRequest and LoginResponse classes
- create a .gitignore file with the unnecessary file extensions those the belong to target files and the ones you consider for both fe and be apps. 
    - add .idea folder and extensions. use * to avoid repetitions
 

##############
I'm getting error compiling the backend app
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.11.0:compile (default-compile) on project order-status-chatbot: Fatal error compiling: java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: Class com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree$JCImport does not have member field 'com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree qualid' -> [Help 1]

#objective
use springdoc openapi dependency to documentate the endpoints created so far.
The idea is to be able to visualize a swagger ui site with all endpoints 

##############
trying to install the frontend app, got this errors:
Failed to compile.

##############
from now on, consider to copy each prompt that I ask and add it to the @prompts.txt file at the end of the file taking into account the following:
- if the prompt starts with #role, you have to add  ############################################################################################################################ 1 line before the new prompt and 1 line after the old prompt.
- in case the prompt does not start with #role, use ############## instead.

do this with the current prompt and make git add and git commit to the latest changes

#objective
consider the @user-stories.md file to work on story 1. 
take the following considerations:
- use spring security to allow customer authentication
- the email and password are stored into the postgres database

############################################################################################################################

##############
got the following error trying with a dummy customer 
JDBC exception executing SQL [select c1_0.id,c1_0.address,c1_0.created_date,c1_0.email,c1_0.enabled,c1_0.first_name,c1_0.last_name,c1_0.password,c1_0.phone,c1_0.updated_date from customers c1_0 where c1_0.email=? and c1_0.enabled=?] [ERROR: column c1_0.enabled does not exist
  Position: 58] [n/a]; SQL [n/a]

##############
check authenticateCustomer method in @backend/AuthService  amd consider to encode the loginRequest password before make the  passwordEncoder.matches condition. Now is never matching

##############
do not consider test controller in the main application

##############
ok, got it, but I'm testing using {
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
} and it does not match

##############
note: I had to modify manually the encoded pwd in scripts and database to make it work.

##############
in @backend/ integrate all .sql files in only one. I just removed the chatbot database to let the application auto create and populate when it is starting up.

#role

#objective
consider the @user-stories.md file to work on story 1.
connect the flow from @frontend/ to @backend/ to complete the authentication.
validate that the user provides a correct email to make the log in operation

##############
the @frontend/ application is getting 200 from @backend/ when doing log in but it does not pass to the next page

##############
still not working I could see the @backend/ response is well, then once it navigates navigate('/chat'); the login page is loaded again

#role

#objective
consider the @user-stories.md file to work on story 2
take the following considerations in@backend/ :
- implement the chat endpoint and integrate with an LLM API
- the endpoint accepts customer messages and returns AI-generated replies
- ensure chatbot persona is polite and customer focused
- handle errors and rate limits gracefully

deliverable: working chat endpoint with authentication applied

#role

#objective
consider the @user-stories.md file to work on story 2
take the following considerations in @frontend/ app:
- connect the front end chat with the @backend/ endpoint previously created.
- ensure the service is calling  the new endpoint and provide the require information

##############
#role

#objective 
consider the @user-stories.md file to work on story 3
RAG (Knowledge Base Retrieval) has to be implemented in this point

take the following considerations in @backend/ 
- Create docs (JSON or YAML format) as knowledge base.
  - consider docs such as order-status-overview, status-transitions, fulfillment-workflow and others you consider to enrich the application.
  - also consider API-style docs (i.e. get-order-status) that describes the get endpoint to get order status including the response (not found orders as well). Add the ones you consider.  
- Use pgvector from postgres database to index the knowledge
- implement retrieval context to the LLM prompt

#deliverable
@backend/ should be ready to use RAG to retrieve order status information

##############
found the following issues:
- review this pgvector-java artifact id that is not found. consider using the one here @https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.pgvector/pgvector/0.1.6
- RagService in @backend/ app is not compiling

##############
I have this issue in postgres database, when hitting CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector; SQL Error [58P01]: ERROR: could not open extension control file "/usr/share/postgresql/13/extension/vector.control": No such file or directory

##############
i prefer option 1

##############
got this error in @backend/ : ERROR: column "embedding" is of type vector but expression is of type bytea

##############
now I see this error: ERROR: column "embedding" is of type vector but expression is of type character varying

##############
I see in @backend/ ragservice class, retrievalRelevantDocuments method this exception at runtime java.lang.ClassCastException: class org.postgresql.util.PGobject cannot be cast to class java.time.LocalDateTime (org.postgresql.util.PGobject is in unnamed module of loader 'app'; java.time.LocalDateTime is in module java.base of loader 'bootstrap')

##############
the app seems to be working fine but why if I provide the order id stored into the database, the flow does not retrieve me information of the order?

##############
make git add and git commit with some comments and push it to main branch

take in account the following considerations in @backend/ 
- check whether the user requires to send the customer id or it can be taken from the authenticated user. Apply the better solution for you.
- customers can not see other customer's order status
- @frontend/ app should be able to see customer order history
