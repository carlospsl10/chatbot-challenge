#goal
design an architecture to create a AI-powered chatbot for an Order Status Service (suppose it gets information from an ecommerce platform) and it needsto be able to interact with clients. The chatbot must be polite, mantain focus on delivering an excellent customer experience, and provide accurate, specific information about the chosen product.

which strategies, programing languages, advices, do you recommend to create this software product.

Do not provide any code, concentrate into the design, components and interactions

Provide some diagram to see the flows if possible.

############################################################################################################################

let's minimize the approach, the idea is to have a small MVP where anybody can see the interaction between a client and a chatbot. Follow these instructions:
- just consider a web application and a back end application.
- authentication and session management is required
- do not consider an apigateway
- only consider clients, orders, customers working with the chatbot
- do not consider working with kubernetes (docker is ok) 
- orders must already exist, the idea is to get information from them.
- consider spring boot project with its dependencies. (do not generate any code so far)

#objective
write clear, actionable user stories and map them to REST endpoints you just described above.

create a md file named user-stories.md with 4-5 stories. Each story must include:
- persona
- story statement
- benefit 
- acceptance criteria
- mapped endpoint (e.g, 'GET /orders/{id}')

#role

#objective
Prepare the scaffolding for front end app (FE) and backend app (BE) projects taking into account the recommendations you gave me above (reactjs for FE, spring boot for BE). Consider the following recomentations: 

- One folder for FE app and other folder for BE app
- Generate directory layout, sample routes, and a basic README.md file

Make a git commit with a short explanation specifying the initial scaffold

##############
change the following things from the backend application:
- remove the AuthController class.
- from OrderController class, remove the OrderService component and add a dummy data for each endpoint without using any external service.
- do not forget to remove unnecesary imports
- remove the LoginRequest and LoginResponse classes
- create a .gitignore file with the unnecessary file extensions those the belong to target files and the ones you consider for both fe and be apps. 
    - add .idea folder and extensions. use * to avoid repetitions
 

##############
I'm getting error compiling the backend app
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.11.0:compile (default-compile) on project order-status-chatbot: Fatal error compiling: java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: Class com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree$JCImport does not have member field 'com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree qualid' -> [Help 1]

##############

#objective
use springdoc openapi dependency to documentate the endpoints created so far.
The idea is to be able to visualize a swagger ui site with all endpoints 

##############
trying to install the frontend app, got this errors:
Failed to compile.

##############
from now on, consider to copy each prompt that I ask and add it to the @prompts.txt file at the end of the file taking into account the following:
- if the prompt starts with #role, you have to add  ############################################################################################################################ 1 line before the new prompt and 1 line after the old prompt.
- in case the prompt does not start with #role, use ############## instead.

do this with the current prompt and make git add and git commit to the latest changes
