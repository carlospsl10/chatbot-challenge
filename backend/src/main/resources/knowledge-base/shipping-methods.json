All shipping methods include package tracking and insurance. Delivery times are estimates and may vary based on destination and carrier availability. International shipping is available to select countries with delivery times of 7-14 business days. Shipping costs are calculated based on order weight, destination, and selected method. Customers can track their packages using the tracking number provided in their order confirmation email or through their account dashboard. Delivery attempts are made during business hours, and packages may be left with a neighbor or at a local post office if no one is available to receive them.",
